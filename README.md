**Medicinal Plant Indentification**

In response to the pressing need for accurate identification of medicinal plants in Ayurvedic Pharmaceutics, we present a comprehensive solution leveraging image processing and machine learning technologies.
Our application utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for initial plant identification. The system not only identifies plants but also offers recommendations for similar species, enriching user experience and facilitating learning. By enabling on-device inference, our application provides real-time results, enhancing functionality and usability. This innovation addresses challenges such as misidentification, adulteration, and resource strain, benefiting stakeholders across the supply chain of medicinal plants.
Through the seamless integration of advanced technologies, our solution promises to revolutionize the identification and utilization of medicinal plants, thereby contributing to the advancement of healthcare and conservationÂ efforts.
